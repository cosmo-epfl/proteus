        each transforming like a Y^L irrep.

        The process can be iterated: a D dimensional array that is the product
        of D Y^m_l can be turned into a set of multiple terms transforming as
        a single Y^M_L.

            If the further index also correspond to spherical harmonics,

        A dictionary tracking the nature of the coupled objects. When called one

        L:(...)x(2L+1)x(...) array. When called multiple times, it applies the
        coupling to each term, and keeps track of the additional l terms, so that

        the form
        (l3,l4,l1,l2) : { L: array }
