For that we will use a communication socket run by i-Pi, which basically outputs a structure produced by the MD and gives it in input to Librascal. This will in turn return energies, forces and stresses by means of the `GenericMDCalculator` class of Librascal. \n",

All these information are initially stored in an input.xml file as specified in the i-Pi documentation at https://github.com/lab-cosmo/i-pi and given as inputs to i-Pi. The Librascal calculator is then launched as a child process and exchanges information with the MD driver.  \n",
